This repository contains notebooks for both the practicals and final assesment for the Machine Learning and Statistics module.<br><br> 
The practicals are as follows:<br><br>

1. [Practical 01 - Statistics Exercises](practicals\01-statistics-exercises.ipynb)<br><br>
This practical centres around the uses of the <code>numpy</code> and <code>scipy</code> libraries to perform statistical analysis on the [Lady Tasting Tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_tasting_tea) Design of Experiments.<br>
The Second part of this notebook walks through the <code>scipy.stats.ttest_ind</code> and improves the example by providing more explanatory text and visualisations.<br><br>

2. [Practical 02 - Model Exercises](practicals\02-model-exercises.ipynb)<br><br>
Exercise 1 in this notebook uses <code>numpy</code> and <matplotlib.pyplot</code> to examine the Absolute Value function and why it is not typically used when fitting straight lines to data.<br>
Exercise 2 involves fitting "stright lines" to a provided data set and determining if this is a "good fit" or not.<br><br>

3. [Practical 03 - Parameters Exercises](practicals\03-Parameters-exercises.ipynb)<br><br>
This notebook contain two exercises where we use <code>numpy.polyfit</code> to fit polynomiala to different datasets.<br><br>

[Macine Learning and Statistics Assesment](anomaly-detection.ipynb)<br><br>
This notebook contains the assesment for the Machine Learning and Statistics module.<br>The instructions for the assesment are as follows:

- On the Keras website, there is an example of <a href="https://keras.io/examples/timeseries/timeseries_anomaly_detection/">time-series anomaly detection</a>. Re-create this example in a notebook of your own, explaining the concepts<br><br>
- Clearly explain each keras function used, referring to the documentation.<br><br>
- Include an introduction to your notebook, setting the context and describing what the reader can expect as they read down through the notebook.<br><br>
- Include a conclusion section where you suggest improvements you could make to the analysis in the notebook.
